Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program requires breaking down stories into basic functionality. User stories provide the background for this functionality. 
I approach developing programs by looking at the project and trying to break it down to its most essential parts. I hope to use Agile in the future in terms of sprint-type work where a clear objective is sought after followed by feedback and testing repeating cyclically until the final product. 
Being a good team member in a software dev team consists of knowing your skills and weaknesses, being open with your team about them, and staying highly focused on the team goals.
